//1.Arithmetic Operators - Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations
//1.1)Addition (+)
let a = 10,b=20;
console.log(a+b);
//1.2)Subtraction (-)
let c = 10,d=20;
console.log(c-d);

//1.3)Multiplication (*)
let e =10,f=20;
console.log(10*20);

//1.4)Division (/)
let g =10,h=20;
console.log(g/h);

//1.5)Modulus (%)
let i =10,j=20;
console.log(i%j);
//1.6)Exponentiation (**)
let k =10,l=20;
console.log(k**l);

//1.7)Increment (++)
let m =20
console.log(m);
m++;
console.log(m);

//1.8)Decrement (--)

let n =22;
console.log(n);
n++;
console.log(n);

//2.Assignment Operators - Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
//2.1)Assignment (=)

//2.2)Addition Assignment (+=)

let o =20
o+=11
console.log(o);
//2.3)Subtraction Assignment (-=):

//2.4)Multiplication Assignment (*=):

//2.5)Division Assignment (/=):

//2.6)Modulus Assignment (%=):

//2.7)Exponentiation Assignment (**=)

//3.Comparison Operators - Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

//3.1)Equal (==)

//3.2)Strict Equal (===)

let p = '5';
if(p === 5){
    console.log('It is equal');
}else{
console.log('it is not equal');
}
//3.4)Not Equal (!=)

//3.5)Strict Not Equal (!==)

//3.6)Greater Than (>)

//3.7)Less Than (<)

//3.8)Greater Than or Equal (>=)

//3.9)Less Than or Equal (<=)

//4.Logical Operators - Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

//4.1)Logical AND (&&)

//4.2)Logical OR (||)

//4.3)Logical NOT (!)

//Example

// String Operators

//String concatenation

//String with Different Quotes:

//Concatenation with Object Properties:

//Template literal
let nName = 'sivasankar';
let aAge = 25;
console.log(`Hi ${nName} welcome here, your age is ${aAge}`)

//Order Prcedence

// New Examples with - and /

// Additional Combined Example
