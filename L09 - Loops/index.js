// Loops
/* 
In programming, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until
a specific condition is met or for a specified number of times.
They provide a way to perform repetitive tasks efficiently without writing
the same code multiple times.

// For Loop Example



for (let i = 1; i <=10; i++) {
    console.log(i+' * 5 = '+ i*5)   
}

//Looping Backwards
for (let i = 10; i >=1; i--) {
    console.log(i+' * 5 = '+ i*5)   
}

//Nested Loop
